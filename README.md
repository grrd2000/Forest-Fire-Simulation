# Forest Fire Simulation
## Introduction
College project on discrete modeling using cellular automata and various image tranformations. 

## Step by step
* The terrain image from google maps is binarized to separate the non-flammable terrain from the rest by the specified key.
* For a more logical and realistic simulation, the image is dilated - removal of small, isolated objects, as well as smoothing out the contours of a binary image. 
* Create a forest fire simulation using cellular automata in a regular window application to create and refine probability coefficients.
* Joining all the steps together.

### The final result
